# NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Count Forecasting

**Forecasting** of New York City's Yellow Taxi trip counts using a large dataset spanning from **2011 to 2024**. Implementation of two models—**XGBoost** and an **LSTM neural network**—to predict **hourly taxi demand**.



The primary goal is to build robust forecasting models that can capture the complex **patterns, trends, and seasonality** in NYC taxi usage over more than a decade.


**Results:**
  XGBoost's RMSE: 1974.8699
  LSTM's RMSE: 0.0095
